# I should be documenting it once the tool is finished (assuming i ever did sa3 5y...)
# TO DO
- refactor db_utils.py cuz it looks and works so bad(stills works tho)
- Implements my previous BeautifulTerminal lib in this cuz why the fuck not
- look more into OOP because i never really bothered to use it for my previous scripts(7byby jesse)
